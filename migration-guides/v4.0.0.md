# v4.0.0 Migration Guide

The only breaking change in this version is the addition of two peer dependencies, `redux-modal` and `react-redux`.

In order to use this version of the library, please make sure the respective versions of these libraries in your parent `package.json` are compatible.

For reference:

- `redux-modal@2` is compatible with `react-redux@5`.
- `redux-modal@3` is compatible with `react-redux@6`, which requires `react@16.14`.

This change enables `lp-hoc` to be used with the latest versions of each of these libraries.
