# v3.0.0 Migration Guide

This version has the following breaking changes:

1. `waitFor` now defaults to displaying the `LoadingSpinner` from `lp-components` instead of the `Loading...` message.

2. `addDefaultClass` has been renamed to `withClassName`

3. `waitForResponse` has been removed. It can be replaced by `waitFor` and `lp-redux-api` selectors.

4. The `name` prop is now required in the `modal` component. The usage of `displayName` is no longer supported:

```js
// use:

export default modal({ name: 'AlertModal' })

// instead of:

AlertModal.displayName = 'AlertModal'
```
